🌟 Introducing "Taste and Trails" – A Simple Yet Elegant Restaurant Website! 🌟

Excited to share my latest project, a minimalist restaurant website named "Taste and Trails", built using HTML and CSS.

This project reflects my passion for web development and attention to detail, combining aesthetics and functionality to create a user-friendly platform for restaurant enthusiasts.

💡 Key Features:
🍴 Clean and intuitive design for seamless user experience
🍴 Responsive layout for optimal performance across devices
🍴 Dedicated sections to highlight menu offerings and the restaurant's story

This project was a great opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills while exploring creative ways to present content.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! 😊
